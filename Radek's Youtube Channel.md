I have summarized Radek's video contents in terms of questions (answers provided)

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">2 Things I Learned on Kaggle Today</mark>  [video](https://youtu.be/S7pv_aU_ER8)
- 2 things for what? 
	- to substantially improve your public scores on Kaggle comp
- The 1st Thing, start [here](https://youtu.be/S7pv_aU_ER8?t=0)
	- what is the first technique?
		- adding labels for data sources by creating a new column
	- how does it work? 
		- if you are combining official dataset with external dataste for training
		- and if you add a column like `external` to distinguish official dataset from external dataset with labels `True` or `False`
		- your model will likely be trained with this new column added is likely to perform better
	- can it be applied to DL models? start [here](https://youtu.be/S7pv_aU_ER8?t=26)
		- yes, of course
	- why this new column can help model to infer better? start [here](https://youtu.be/S7pv_aU_ER8?t=37)
		- this column can enable model to try to understand how the differences of two datasets affect performance
		- the model can give more appropriate predictions on the test set based on which data source it is from.
- The 2nd Thing, start [here](https://youtu.be/S7pv_aU_ER8?t=59)
	- what's the 2nd technique?
		- adding a column (distance between your location and landmarks) to your dataset
	- how does it work?
		- if you have longtitude and lattitude columns for house locations
		- if you have landmarks geoinfo which enables the calculation of the distance between your locations and the landmarks
		- the distance column can very likely improve your model's performance
	- why?
		- because domain knowledge tells us that important landmarks can influence the price of houses a lot
