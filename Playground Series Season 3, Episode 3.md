#### <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Goal of Playground Series</mark> 

> the goals of the Playground Series remain the sameâ€”to give the Kaggle community a variety of fairly light-weight challenges that can be used to learn and sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science. 

It means we should try as many models and techniques as we could and iterate as fast as we can

#### <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">What about generated dataset</mark> 

> These will be fairly light-weight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data, and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.

> Using synthetic data for Playground competitions allows us to strike a balance between having real-world data (with named features) and ensuring test labels are not publicly available. This allows us to host competitions with more interesting datasets than in the past. 

> While there are still challenges with synthetic data generation, the state-of-the-art is much better now than when we started the Tabular Playground Series two years ago, and that goal is to produce datasets that have <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">far fewer artifacts</mark> . 

What are `artifacts` and why they sound like a bad thing?
