## <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Resistance and Motivation for this project</mark> 

#### <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Resistance</mark> 
- I have decided to fully focused on learning by doing kaggle competition
- I just got the momentum of doing so
- I don't want to abandon it

#### <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Motivation</mark> 

**This project can speed up my journey on Kaggle**
- I already feel frustration in makeing progress in learning from kaggle on recsys, but I managed to keep going by building competition template
- growing a template by studying many kaggle notebooks is a on-going process which demands real perseverance
- But how to feel progress when building template?
- Here is what I say to myself: a more efficient way of building my recsys or any problem-based template is to build upon my proficiency on competent libraries dealing with recsys, such as `merlin.model` and `NvTabular`
- Then the real challenge becomes how efficient I can become competent in applying these new libraries in real competitions instead of just reading and experimenting docs/codebase per se.
- I think building a chatbot focused on those libraries can really speed me up.

**This project can actually begin to satisfy the desire which lured me back to DL/ML world**
- As free version chatGPT is proved to be very competent as [[How to make GPT-3 my coding tutor|my personal code explainer]] , I think it could be the time to actually using gpt-3 to do what I have always wanted to do for my life.
- I would like to learn a subject by asking questions (diving deeper and deeper) with a personalized chatbot focused on the subject
- The subjects including necessary medical knoweldge on our health, DL/ML, physics, ...


## <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">My goal for the project</mark> 

I want a personalized tutor focused on a small knowledge pool like 
- fastai docs and codebases
- merlin docs and codebases
- DL books by fastai and huggingface etc
- physics by Feyman 
- many more


## <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Learn LangChain with a doc chatbot</mark> 

- using doct chatbot [website](https://chat.langchain.dev/) for Q&A  while reading docs myself
- I found it to be very efficient way of learning docs (not tested codes yet), see [[Learn LangChain with its doc chatbot]] for details
