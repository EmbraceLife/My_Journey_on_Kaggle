- follow @radek1 on Kaggle Playground Series, starting with Season 3, hopefully more
	- make otto comp small and iterate it fast like Playground Series
	- Kaggle competitions to explore

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Highlights of inspirations on my journey</mark> 

> I have given up on learning ML/DL before, and I came back May 2022. Thanks to your book and fastai, I won't give it up anymore. Why? 1) the super amazing fastai alumni share selflessly online, 2) I need no permission to "hold their hands" and learn from them without limit publicly. from this [tweet](https://twitter.com/shendusuipian/status/1611871815856717824?s=20&t=gYNw-VpBaKpPUNQRzYdRHw)


<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">My story, my path</mark> 

- I spent 2 months to do detailed notes of courses, but notes alone does not make me a DL practitioner 😱 😭
- I spent 2-3 months to write a little tool to help me debug faster and help me get rid of the fear of reading and experimenting fastcore and fastai source codes 🎉 😂
- however, it still does not help me move toward a DL practitioner 😱 😭
- Thanks to Radek's book Meta-learning 💕
	- I learn to surrender my own assumptions about learning and start to embrace fastai way of learning - practice and experiment 🔥
	- I get started to learn on Kaggle and use Radek's posts and notebooks as my guide on OTTO recsys competition
- After spending more than one month in the comp, I am totally stuck on implementing a model pipeline provided by Chris and I think the main cause is I don't know pandas enough. ⛔ 
- 😂 💕 I can't say "Thank You" enough to the amazing @wasimlorgat who patiently and thoughtfully helps me understands what I want and how I learn and why I get stuck and how to unstuck, below are just a few he taught me:  😂 💕 🚀
	- to avoid rabbit holes like diving deep into learning pandas or polars 🦮
	- writing down my goals or todos before action to stay focused and to finish fast 🚀
	- not to give in to discouraging thoughts, but to recognize and celebrate every little progress along the way 💗
- In OTTO comp 🔥
	- I learnt to read and follow discussions to learn small tricks to improve my public scores
	- I learnt to running and tweaking notebooks by Radek and Chris Deotte, and my previous experience in debugging help me to understand every line of their code without fear 🎉 ⭐
	- I learnt to not give up when stuck but find easier tasks to build up my skills and come back later
- In Playground Series, Season 3 comp 🔥
	- I , for the first time, understand what Jeremy and Radek meant by 'iterate fast'
	- I changed my views on toy dataset and comps, and realized they can be powerful tools for learning new and important techniques fast
