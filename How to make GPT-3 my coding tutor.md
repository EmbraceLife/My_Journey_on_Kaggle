At the moment 2023.1.26, I only test it out using <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">free version</mark> chatGPT.

### <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Here are my findings</mark> 

- I have tried both chatGPT and github copilot, as a beginner of ML/DL, I found chatGPT is a lot more suitable than the copilot to be a coding tutor to explain codes to me. (but copilot now has a copilot lab which provide explanation feature too)
- chatGPT is great at answering questions about how to understand codes, but can't help to hallucinate (so does copilot) when asked to give codes to perform tasks, even when I set `temperature` to 0. 
- but I feel ok about hallucination when chatGPT is explaining the given correct codes, maybe because the hallucinations here benefit me more than hurt.

## <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Explaining code to me</mark> 

## <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Ask chatGPT to explain a simple code on `merlin.models` library (new to me) </mark> 

```python 
import os 
import merlin.models.tf as mm 
from merlin.datasets.entertainment import get_movielens 
input_path = os.environ.get("INPUT_DATA_DIR", os.path.expanduser("~/merlin-models-data/movielens/")) 
train, valid = get_movielens(variant="ml-1m", path=input_path) 
schema = train.schema.without(['rating']) 
model = mm.DLRMModel( schema, 
					 embedding_dim=64, 
					 bottom_block=mm.MLPBlock([128, 64]), 
					 top_block=mm.MLPBlock([128, 64, 32]), 
					 prediction_tasks=mm.OutputBlock(schema), ) 
model.compile(optimizer="adam") 
model.fit(train, batch_size=1024) 
metrics = model.evaluate(valid, batch_size=1024, return_dict=True) 
``` 

#### <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Can you explain the block of code above to me? </mark> 

> The code above imports the `os`, `merlin.models.tf` and `merlin.datasets.entertainment` modules in python. It then uses the `get_movielens` function from the `merlin.datasets.entertainment` module to load the `movielens` dataset with the variant "ml-1m" from the directory specified by the `input_path` variable. The `train` and `valid` variables are then assigned the returned values of the `get_movielens` function call.
> 
> Next, the code defines a `schema` variable, which is a copy of the `train` dataset's schema, but without the 'rating' column.
> 
> The code then creates a DLRM (Deep Learning Recommendation Model) using the `mm.DLRMModel` class from the `merlin.models.tf` module. The DLRM is composed of an embedding layer, a bottom block (MLPBlock) with 2 layers of 128 and 64 neurons respectively, a top block (MLPBlock) with 3 layers of 128, 64 and 32 neurons respectively and a output block with the prediction tasks.
> 
> The code then compiles the model with the "adam" optimizer and fits the model on the `train` dataset with a batch size of 1024. Finally, the code evaluates the model on the `valid` dataset with a batch size of 1024 and assigns the returned metrics to the `metrics` variable.

#### <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Why do we need modules like `os`, `merlin.models.tf`, `merlin.datasets.entertainment` here</mark> 


> The `os` module is used to interact with the operating system. In this case, it is used to access environment variables and expand the user's home directory path.

> `merlin.models.tf` is a module from the Merlin library that provides a set of pre-defined TensorFlow-based models for various machine learning tasks. In this case, the `mm.DLRMModel` class is used to create a Deep Learning Recommendation Model.

> `merlin.datasets.entertainment` is a module from the Merlin library that provides a set of pre-defined datasets for entertainment-related tasks such as recommendation systems. In this case, the `get_movielens` function is used to load the MovieLens dataset.


#### <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Can you explain step by step what does the line of code below do?</mark> 

```python
input_path = os.environ.get("INPUT_DATA_DIR", os.path.expanduser("~/merlin-models-data/movielens/"))
```

> Yes, the line of code above does the following
> 1.  `os.environ.get("INPUT_DATA_DIR")`: It retrieves the value of the environment variable named "INPUT_DATA_DIR" and assigns it to the `input_path` variable. If the environment variable is not set, it returns `None`.
>2.  `os.path.expanduser("~/merlin-models-data/movielens/")`: It expands the "~~" character to the path of the home directory of the current user. So the string "~~/merlin-models-data/movielens/" will be converted to the full path of the "merlin-models-data/movielens" directory in the home directory of the current user.
>3.  `os.environ.get("INPUT_DATA_DIR", os.path.expanduser("~/merlin-models-data/movielens/"))`: It checks if the `input_path` variable is `None` or not. If it is not `None`, it assigns the value of the environment variable to `input_path`. If it is `None`, it assigns the expanded path of the "merlin-models-data/movielens" directory in the home directory of the current user to `input_path`.
> In summary, the line of code above retrieves the value of the environment variable "INPUT_DATA_DIR" and assigns it to the `input_path` variable. If the environment variable is not set, it assigns the expanded path of the "merlin-models-data/movielens" directory in the home directory of the current user to `input_path`.

If it is not clear to me, I can ask it to regenerate the answer, it is equally good if not better. 

> Sure, the line of code above does the following:
> 1.  It uses the `os.environ.get()` method to try to get the value of the environment variable `INPUT_DATA_DIR`.
> 2.  If the variable is not found, then the `os.path.expanduser()` function is called with the argument "~/merlin-models-data/movielens/".
> 3.  The `os.path.expanduser()` method returns the path to the specified directory with the `~` (tilde) character replaced by the current user's home directory.
> 4.  The result of either the `os.environ.get()` method or the `os.path.expanduser()` function call is then assigned to the `input_path` variable.
> In summary, the line of code above is checking for the existence of an environment variable `INPUT_DATA_DIR` and if it is not defined, it sets the `input_path` variable to the path of the "merlin-models-data/movielens" directory located in the current user's home directory. This variable will be used later to load the movielens dataset.


#### <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Can you explain this code to me step by step? `train, valid = get_movielens(variant="ml-1m", path=input_path)` </mark>

> Sure, the line of code above does the following:

> 1.  It calls the `get_movielens` function from the `merlin.datasets.entertainment` module with the `variant` parameter set to "ml-1m" and the `path` parameter set to the value of the `input_path` variable.
> 2.  This function returns two datasets, one for training and one for validation, which are then unpacked and assigned to the `train` and `valid` variables respectively.

> In summary, this line of code is loading the movielens dataset with variant "ml-1m" and with the path specified in `input_path` variable, and then it is splitting the dataset into two different datasets, one for training and one for validation which are assigned to `train` and `valid` variable respectively. This `train` and `valid` datasets will be used later to train and evaluate the model.

#### <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">what does the variant 'ml-1m' mean? (I totally didn't expect a good answer)</mark> 

> The variant "ml-1m" refers to a specific version of the MovieLens dataset, which is a dataset commonly used for research in recommendation systems.

> The "ml-1m" variant stands for MovieLens 1 million, which contains 1 million ratings from 6000 users on 4000 movies. This dataset is one of the smaller versions of the MovieLens dataset and it is widely used for testing and benchmarking recommendation algorithms. Other variants of the MovieLens dataset are available, such as "ml-20m" which has 20 million ratings, and "ml-100k" which has 100,000 ratings. Each variant has different characteristics in terms of the number of users, items and ratings, which can be useful for testing different kinds of recommendation models and systems.

#### <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">`schema = train.schema.without(['rating']) ` Could you explain this code to me step by step?</mark> 

> Sure, the line of code above does the following:

> 1.  It accesses the `schema` attribute of the `train` dataset.
> 2.  It calls the `without()` method on the `schema` object, passing in an array containing the string `"rating"`.
> 3.  This method returns a new schema object that is identical to the original schema, but without the `rating` column.
> 4.  The new schema object is then assigned to the `schema` variable.

> In summary, this line of code is creating a new schema object by removing the 'rating' column from the schema of the `train` dataset and assigns it to the `schema` variable. This new schema object will be used later to create the DLRM model. It is important to note that the `schema` object describes the structure of the data, including the names and types of columns.

#### <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">What is this `schema` thing? what does it do? why do we need it?</mark> 

> A `schema` is a way of describing the structure of a dataset, including the names and types of columns. It is used to define the structure of the data that a machine learning model will be trained on and make predictions on.

> In the context of the code you provided, the `schema` variable is used to define the structure of the data that the `DLRMModel` will be trained on. The `DLRMModel` requires a schema to understand the input and output of the data it will be working with. The `schema` variable is defined by removing the 'rating' column from the original schema of the `train` dataset, which is the target variable that the model is trying to predict. This is why the schema is not including the 'rating' column.

> It's important to note that the `schema` object is not the data itself, but rather a description of the data. It's used to define the structure of the data, allowing the model to understand how to process the data and make predictions.


#### <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">`model = mm.DLRMModel( schema, embedding_dim=64, bottom_block=mm.MLPBlock([128, 64]), top_block=mm.MLPBlock([128, 64, 32]), prediction_tasks=mm.OutputBlock(schema), )` Could you explain this code step by step?</mark> 

> Sure, the code above does the following:

> 1.  It creates an instance of the `DLRMModel` class from the `merlin.models.tf` module, passing in several parameters.
> 2.  The first parameter is the `schema` variable which was created earlier and defined the structure of the data.
> 3.  The `embedding_dim` parameter is set to 64, which determines the size of the embedding vectors used to represent the categorical variables in the model.
> 4.  The `bottom_block` parameter is set to an instance of the `MLPBlock` class, which is a pre-defined neural network block from the `merlin.models.tf` module. The `MLPBlock` is initialized with a list containing the integers 128 and 64, which determine the number of units in the hidden layers of the neural network.
> 5.  The `top_block` parameter is set to another instance of the `MLPBlock` class, this time it is initialized with a list containing the integers 128, 64, and 32, which determine the number of units in the hidden layers of the neural network.
> 6.  The `prediction_tasks` parameter is set to an instance of the `OutputBlock` class, which is also a pre-defined neural network block from the `merlin.models.tf` module, and it is initialized with the `schema` variable,
> 7.  This creates a DLRM model with the specified parameters and assigns it to the `model` variable.

> In summary, the above code is creating an instance of the `DLRMModel` class, which is a deep learning recommendation model. It is passing several parameters to configure the model:

> -   The first parameter is the `schema` variable, which describes the structure of the data

(run out of length I think)

#### <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">What does `embedding_dim` do exactly here? What exactly do we need it for?</mark> 

> The `embedding_dim` parameter sets the size of the embedding vectors that are used to represent the categorical variables in the DLRM model. In a recommendation system, a categorical variable is a variable that can take on a limited number of values, such as a user id, movie id, and so on.

> Embedding is a technique used to represent these categorical variables in a continuous space, so that they can be processed by a neural network. The `embedding_dim` parameter determines the number of dimensions in this continuous space, where each dimension is called an embedding dimension. A larger value for `embedding_dim` means that each categorical variable will be represented by a larger vector with more dimensions, and therefore can capture more complex relationships between the categorical variables and the target variable.

> Using embeddings allows the model to learn a more expressive representation of the categorical variables, which can lead to improved performance on the recommendation task. In other words, the embedding layers allow the model to learn a more complex relationship between the categorical variables and the target variable, which can improve the model's ability to make accurate recommendations.

I asked it to regenerate the answer and since it is very long and exceeds its length limits, so I then asked it to continue in a follow up question.

> `embedding_dim` is a parameter that determines the size of the embedding vectors used to represent the categorical variables in the model.

> In a deep learning recommendation model, the input data typically includes both numerical and categorical variables, such as user and item IDs. Categorical variables, <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">such as IDs, are typically represented as integers</mark> , but neural networks can only process numerical data, so we need to convert the categorical variables into numerical representations. One way to do this is by using an embedding layer, which creates a dense vector representation of the categorical variable, this is called an embedding vector. The `embedding_dim` parameter determines the size of these embedding vectors.

> For example, if the `embedding_dim` parameter is set to 64, it means that each unique categorical variable will be represented by <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">a 64-dimensional vector</mark> . This vector can be thought of as a set of weights that the model will learn during training, and the model will use these weights to make predictions. A higher value of the `embedding_dim` will allow the model to capture more information about the categorical variables, but it also increases the number of parameters to learn, which may lead to overfitting. Conversely, a lower value of the `embedding_dim` may not capture enough information about the categorical variables, which may lead to underfitting.

> In other words, the `embedding_dim` parameter is a hyper-parameter that controls the size of the embedding vectors used to represent the categorical variables in the model, and it is an important factor (exceed the word limit for each answer)

> Sure, to continue, The `embedding_dim` parameter is an important factor in determining the model's capacity to represent the categorical variables, and in turn, its ability to make accurate predictions. It's a trade-off between the model's ability to capture the information about the categorical variables and the risk of overfitting.

> It's also worth noting that this `DLRM` model uses two different neural network blocks, the `bottom_block` and `top_block`, which are instances of the `MLPBlock` class. These blocks are used to configure the neural network architecture, and they are initialized with lists of integers that determine the number of units in the hidden layers of the neural network. These integers are also hyper-parameters, and they control the capacity of the model.

> In summary, the `embedding_dim` parameter is a hyper-parameter that determines the size of the embedding vectors used to represent the categorical variables in the model, and it's an important factor in determining the model's capacity to represent the categorical variables and make accurate predictions. The `bottom_block` and `top_block` parameters are used to configure the neural network architecture by using pre-defined neural network blocks from `merlin.models.tf` module and they control the number of units in the hidden layers of the neural network.


#### <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">What are `bottom_block` and `top_block`? and Why do we need them? How do we create them?</mark> 

> `bottom_block` and `top_block` are parameters that are used to configure the neural network architecture in the `DLRM` model. They are instances of the `MLPBlock` class, which is a pre-defined neural network block from the `merlin.models.tf` module.

> The `DLRM` model uses a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architecture, which consists of multiple layers of neurons, with the input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. The `bottom_block` and `top_block` parameters are used to configure the architecture of the hidden layers in the neural network.

> The `bottom_block` parameter is used to configure the architecture of the bottom part of the neural network, which <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">is responsible for processing the sparse features (categorical variables).</mark> The `top_block` parameter is used to configure the architecture of the top part of the neural network, which is <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">responsible for processing the dense features (numerical variables) and the interactions between the sparse and dense features.</mark> 

> Both `bottom_block` and `top_block` are initialized with lists of integers that determine the number of units in the hidden layers of the neural network. These integers are also hyper-parameters, and they control the capacity of the model.

> For example, in the code you provided, the `bottom_block` is initialized with the list `[128, 64]`, which means that the bottom part of the neural network will have <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">two hidden layers</mark> with 128 and 64 units, respectively. Similarly, the `top_block` is initialized with the list `[128, 64, 32]`, which means that the top part of the neural network will have <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">three hidden layers </mark> with 128, 64 and 32 units respectively.

> In summary, `bottom_block` and `top_block` are pre-defined neural network blocks from `merlin.models.tf` module, they are used to configure the architecture of the hidden layers in the neural network of `DLRM` model, `bottom_block` is used to configure the architecture of the bottom part of the neural network, which is responsible for processing the sparse features (categorical variables) and `top_block` is used to configure the architecture of the top part of the neural network, which is responsible for processing the dense features (numerical variables) and the interactions between the sparse and dense features. They are initialized with lists of integers that determine the number of units in the hidden layers of the neural network and these integers are also hyper-parameters that control the capacity of the model.


#### <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Speaking of `bottom_block` and `top_block`, where exactly is the `bottom` and `top` inside the model structure</mark> 

In the context of the code you provided, "bottom" and "top" refer to different parts of the neural network architecture in the `DLRM` model. The "bottom" part of the network typically refers to the layers that are closer to the input data, while the "top" part of the network refers to the layers that are closer to the output data.

In the provided code, `bottom_block` is an instance of `mm.MLPBlock` class, which is used to configure the architecture of the hidden layers that are closer to the input data. Similarly, `top_block` is also an instance of `mm.MLPBlock` class, which is used to configure the architecture of the hidden layers that are closer to the output data.

It's worth noting that this distinction is somewhat arbitrary and it's the developer's choice, so it doesn't reflect a strict rule about where these layers are located in the model, but rather it's a way of differentiating the different parts of the architecture.

#### <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">What are `mm.MLPBlock` and `mm.OutputBlock` ? Why do we need them? How do we use them?</mark> 

>`mm.MLPBlock` and `mm.OutputBlock` are pre-defined neural network blocks from the `merlin.models.tf` module. They are used to configure the architecture of the neural network in the `DLRM` model.

> `mm.MLPBlock` is used to configure the architecture of multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network, which is a neural network with one or more hidden layers and an output layer. It is used to configure the architecture of the hidden layers in the neural network. It is initialized with a list of integers, which determines the number of units in the hidden layers of the neural network.

> `mm.OutputBlock` is used to configure the architecture of the output layer in the neural network. It takes the `schema` as an input which is responsible for providing the necessary information about the output variables and their types, so that the output layer can be configured accordingly.

> In the provided code, `bottom_block` and `top_block` are instances of `mm.MLPBlock` class, which is used to configure the architecture of the hidden layers in the neural network. `prediction_tasks` is instance of `mm.OutputBlock` class, which is used to configure the architecture of the output layer in the neural network.

> In summary, `mm.MLPBlock` and `mm.OutputBlock` are pre-defined neural network blocks from `merlin.models.tf` module, `mm.MLPBlock` is used to configure the architecture of the hidden layers in the neural network and `mm.OutputBlock` is used to configure the architecture of the output layer in the neural network. They are used in `DLRM` model to specify the architecture of the neural network and they are initialized with appropriate inputs, such as a list of integers for `mm.MLPBlock` and `schema` for `mm.OutputBlock`

#### <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Could you suggest some code for doing hyperparameter search for the model above?</mark> 

> Sure! Here's an example of how you could perform a hyperparameter search for the `DLRM` model:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from merlin.models.tf import DLRMModel

param_grid = {
    'embedding_dim': [32, 64, 128],
    'bottom_block': [mm.MLPBlock([32, 16]), mm.MLPBlock([64, 32])],
    'top_block': [mm.MLPBlock([32, 16]), mm.MLPBlock([64, 32])],
    'batch_size': [512, 1024, 2048],
    'learning_rate': [1e-3, 1e-4],
}

grid_search = GridSearchCV(DLRMModel(schema, prediction_tasks=mm.OutputBlock(schema)), param_grid, cv=3)
grid_search.fit(train)
```

> This code uses `GridSearchCV` from `sklearn.model_selection` to perform a search over a specified set of hyperparameters. The set of hyperparameters to search over is defined in the `param_grid` dictionary, which in this case includes the `embedding_dim`, `bottom_block`, `top_block`, `batch_size`, and `learning_rate`. The `GridSearchCV` object is initialized with an instance of `DLRMModel` and the `param_grid` dictionary, and it will perform a search over all possible combinations of hyperparameter values.

> The `GridSearchCV` object is then fit to the training data using the `fit` method, which will train the model multiple times with different hyperparameter values and return the best set of hyperparameters based on the performance on the validation set.

> It's worth noting that this is a simple example of how to perform a hyperparameter search, and in practice you might want to use more advanced techniques, such as `RandomizedSearchCV` or other more sophisticated optimization algorithms like `Bayesian optimization`. Also, the example is using a small grid of possible values, you may want to `consider a more dense grid or even a continuous search space for the hyperparameters` depending on the size of the data and the computational resources you have.


#### <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Can you explain to me what does `GridSearchCV` do and how to use it step by step?</mark> 

> `GridSearchCV` is a class from the `sklearn.model_selection` module that performs an exhaustive search over specified parameter values for an estimator. It works by training the estimator multiple times with different combinations of parameter values, and it returns the best set of parameters based on the performance on a validation set.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how `GridSearchCV` works:

> 1.  Create an instance of the classifier you want to use, in your case `DLRMModel`, and specify the parameters you want to search over. This is done by passing the classifier and the parameter grid to the `GridSearchCV` constructor. The parameter grid is a dictionary where the keys are the names of the parameters and the values are the possible values for those parameters.
    
> 2.  Use the `fit` method of the `GridSearchCV` object to fit the classifier to the training data. This will train the classifier multiple times with different combinations of parameter values.
    
> 3.  The `GridSearchCV` object will return the best set of parameters based on the performance on the validation set. You can access the best parameters via `grid_search.best_params_`, the best score via `grid_search.best_score_`, the best estimator via `grid_search.best_estimator_`
    
> 4.  Once the search is finished, you can use the best estimator to make predictions on new data using the `predict` method.
    

> It's worth noting that the `GridSearchCV` uses by default <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">3-fold cross-validation</mark> , which means that the data is divided into 3 parts, the model is trained 3 times, each time using two parts as the training set and one part as the validation set. The performance is measured by the performance on on the validation set, and the combination of parameters that results in the best performance is chosen as the best set of parameters. (this paragraph is split into two answers due to running out of length limit)

> Here is an example of how you could use `GridSearchCV` to do a hyperparameter search for the `DLRMModel`:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

param_grid = {'embedding_dim': [32, 64, 128],
              'bottom_block': [mm.MLPBlock([64, 32]), mm.MLPBlock([128, 64])],
              'top_block': [mm.MLPBlock([64, 32]), mm.MLPBlock([128, 64])],
              }

grid_search = GridSearchCV(model, param_grid, cv=3, return_train_score=True)
grid_search.fit(train)

```

> This will train and evaluate the `DLRMModel` with different combinations of `embedding_dim`, `bottom_block` and `top_block` parameters, it will use 3-fold cross-validation to evaluate the models and it will return the best set of parameters based on the performance on the validation set. You can access the best parameters via `grid_search.best_params_`, the best score via `grid_search.best_score_`, the best estimator via `grid_search.best_estimator_`

> It's worth noting that this is just an example and you should adjust the parameters and the values accordingly based on your use case and the data you are working with.

#### <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">what does this line of code `model.compile(optimizer="adam")` do exactly?</mark> 

> The `compile()` method of a Keras model is used to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">configure the model for training by specifying the optimizer, loss function, and metrics</mark> .

> In the line of code you provided, the `optimizer` argument is set to "adam", which specifies the Adam optimizer algorithm to be used during training. The Adam optimizer is an adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm that's commonly used in deep learning because it tends to work well in practice.

> The Adam optimizer algorithm adjusts the learning rate during training to converge to the optimal values of the parameters of the model. The learning rate is the step size that the optimizer uses to adjust the parameters of the model in the direction of the minimum loss. The Adam optimizer uses a combination of gradient descent and momentum to adjust the learning rate adaptively, which can help the model converge faster and avoid getting stuck in local minima.

> In summary, the `compile()` method sets the optimizer that will be used to train the model and the optimizer is responsible for adjusting the parameters of the model in order to minimize the loss function.

#### <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Could you tell me all the optimizers can keras provide for us to use in this code block example?</mark> 

> Yes, Keras provides several optimizers that can be used to train neural networks, some of the most popular ones include:

1.  `SGD` : Stochastic Gradient Descent optimizer.
2.  `RMSprop` : RMSprop optimizer.
3.  `Adagrad` : Adagrad optimizer.
4.  `Adadelta` : Adadelta optimizer.
5.  `Adam` : Adam optimizer.
6.  `Adamax` : Adamax optimizer from Adam paper's Section 7.
7.  `Nadam`: Nesterov Adam optimizer.
8.  `Ftrl`: FTRL optimizer.
9.  `AdamW`: AdamW optimizer.
10.  `Amsgrad` : Amsgrad optimizer from Reddi et al.
11.  `Lbfgs` : L-BFGS optimizer.
12.  `Nadam` : Nadam optimizer

> It's worth noting that optimizers in Keras can be called by passing a string argument to the optimizer parameter in the `compile()` method of the model, and also some of them accept different hyper-parameters such as learning rate, momentum and others.


#### <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">What's the most used optimizer in Merlin.model library?</mark> 

> It's hard to say what the most used optimizer is in the Merlin.model library as it could depend on the specific problem and dataset being used, as well as the preference of the developer. However, it is common to see `Adam` optimizer used in deep learning models due to its ability to adjust the learning rate adaptively, as well as its good performance on a wide range of problems.

> It's worth noting that the Merlin.model library is built on top of TensorFlow, so <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">any optimizer that is available in TensorFlow can be used in Merlin.model</mark> . And also, the Merlin.model library provide a `compile` function which can be used to specify the optimizer, loss function and evaluation metric for a model, and the default optimizer is Adam.

### <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">It can't help to hallucinate when I asked it to give me code to do hyperparameter search on the merlin model </mark> 

#### <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Can we do hyperparameter search with merlin model library?</mark> 

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">There is no such library nor function as answered below</mark> 

> Yes, it is possible to do hyperparameter search with the Merlin model library. The library provides the `HyperparameterSearch` class which provides a convenient way to perform hyperparameter search. The `HyperparameterSearch` class allows you to specify the range of values for different hyperparameters and then it will train and evaluate the model for each combination of the hyperparameters.

> Here is an example of how you can use the `HyperparameterSearch` class to perform hyperparameter search on the DLRM model you provided:

```python
from merlin.hyperparameter_search import HyperparameterSearch

hyperparameters = {
    'embedding_dim': [32, 64, 128],
    'bottom_block': [[64, 32], [128, 64], [256, 128]],
    'top_block': [[64, 32], [128, 64], [256, 128]],
}

search = HyperparameterSearch(model, train, valid, hyperparameters, metric='mse')
search.run()

```

> This code first defines a dictionary of the hyperparameters that you want to search over, then it creates an instance of the `HyperparameterSearch` class, passing in the model, train and valid data, the hyperparameters and the metric that you want to use for evaluation. Finally, it calls the `run()` method to start the hyperparameter search. The `HyperparameterSearch` class will train and evaluate the model for each combination of the hyperparameters and will return the best combination of hyperparameters that give the best performance.

#### <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Can you use `keras_tuner` to do hyperparameter search for this merlin model?</mark> 

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">There is no such thing as `to_keras`</mark> 

> `keras-tuner` is a library that allows for easy hyperparameter tuning for Keras models. Unfortunately, Merlin models are not built using Keras, so `keras-tuner` cannot be used directly with Merlin models.

> However, it is possible to convert a Merlin model to a Keras model using the `to_keras()` method provided by Merlin. Once the model is converted to Keras, you can use `keras-tuner` to perform hyperparameter search.

> Here is an example of how to use `keras-tuner` to perform hyperparameter search on a Merlin model:

```python
from merlin.models.tf import DLRMModel
from keras.optimizers import Adam
from keras_tuner import RandomSearch
from keras.losses import mean_squared_error

input_path = os.environ.get("INPUT_DATA_DIR", os.path.expanduser("~/merlin-models-data/movielens/"))
train, valid = get_movielens(variant="ml-1m", path=input_path)
schema = train.schema.without(['rating'])

# Define the model
model = DLRMModel(schema, 
                  embedding_dim=64, 
                  bottom_block=mm.MLPBlock([128, 64]), 
                  top_block=mm.MLPBlock([128, 64, 32]), 
                  prediction_tasks=mm.OutputBlock(schema), 
                 ) 

# Convert to Keras model
keras_model = model.to_keras()

# Define the search space
def build_model(hp):
    model = keras_model
    model.compile(
        optimizer=Adam(hp.Choice('learning_rate', [1e-2, 1e-3, 1e-4])),
        loss=mean_squared_error
    )
    return model

# perform hyperparameter search
tuner = RandomSearch(build_model, objective='val_loss', max_trials=20)
tuner.search(train,valid, epochs=10, batch_size=1024)

# Get the best model
best_model = tuner.get_best_models(num_models=1)[0]

```

> This example uses `RandomSearch` to search over the learning rate values of `1e-2`, `1e-3`, and `1e-4`. It also defines the objective of the search as the validation loss. `max_trials` is set to 20, which means that it will try out 20 different sets of hyperparameters.

> Keep in mind that this is just an example and you'll have to adjust it to match your specific use case.
