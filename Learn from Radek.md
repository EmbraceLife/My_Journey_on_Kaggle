- Figure out what is important 
	- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">training</mark>  and <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">iterating</mark> models is the only most important thing
- Focus on it
- Forget the rest
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">reduce</mark> time for anything else, e.g., hardware, courses, frameworks
	- dig into one framework until <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">proficiency in key concepts</mark> enable you to switch between frameworks with ease

> Focus on that one thing. Don't worry about what others do. You are the main protagonist in your own story!

> Don't listen to what worked for people who are vastly different to who you are.

> Be your own best thermostat. React to your current setting.

> Eliminate the bottleneck to make the whole system of you as a machine learning practitioner running much more smoothly!

- What's the one thing, the bottleneck for me?  😱😱😱
	- not build pipelines enough, not iterate pipelines enough
- How will I tackle this bottleneck? 🏇🏇🏇
	- on Kaggle, it's more like learning to build and iterate in the wild, I don't know what I will learn each day, if lucky I can find guides along the way, but in general it's more of keep exploring not knowing what is ahead
	- I learnt how to build and iterate fast from Kaggle comp like Playground Series, and I am super excited about it because I feel this is what I am missing.
	- on fastai part1, part2, wwf, I know what's ahead is systematic and promising to build me up as a proper practitioner, but the tasks are overwhemingly massive. 
	- My plan is to turn course notebooks and kaggle comps into building and iterating pipelines in which I will learn all the techniques of fastai in time.

- Secret - Perseverence 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 ^893aa2
	- Perseverence is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not intensity</mark> which often goes against perseverence
	- Perseverence is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not discipline</mark> but to find your passion and emotions power at
	- Perseverence is the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">ability to return to the same thing</mark> over weeks, months, years
		- first, pick the thing you are truly <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">passionate</mark> about, which will sustain your perseverence
	- why perseverence is important
		- you need to give <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">time</mark> to learn and practice
		- it takes time to find the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">right strategy</mark> to work for you
